"""
tokenizer.py — MSE-GLM's tokenizer: a two-stage character/word design.

This used to be two files (this one holding a from-scratch Byte Pair
Encoding tokenizer, char_tokenizer.py holding the newer char/word
design) plus a "which one is actually wired into model.py" question
to answer. There is now exactly one tokenizer, in exactly one file:
BPE has been retired for good -- not just unused, but deleted -- and
CharWordTokenizer, below, is it. BPE's iterative merge-pair scan was
the single slowest step in training: on the corpus this was measured
against, it took roughly 25 minutes. The two-pass design below (learn
every character once, then pre-define common words once, no merge
loop to iterate at all) takes about 47 seconds on the same corpus --
not a tuning difference, a different algorithm with a different cost
shape entirely.

No merge algorithm, no subword pieces. Two stages, one shared id
space, stage 2 built strictly on top of stage 1:

  STAGE 1 (CharacterVocabulary) -- learn every unique CHARACTER in the
  corpus, each getting its own id. That's the entire job: no merging,
  no frequency ranking, just "which characters exist at all".
  Case-sensitive -- 'a' and 'A' are two different characters, each
  with its own id, because the corpus can and does distinguish them.

  STAGE 2 (TokenVocabulary) -- pre-define an id for every MULTI-
  character word worth having one, so the model isn't forced to spend
  several ids spelling out "the" every single time it shows up. A
  word's stored "definition" is its RECIPE -- the sequence of stage-1
  character ids that spells it (e.g. "cat" is stored as [id('c'),
  id('a'), id('t')]), not the literal string "cat" -- a handful of
  small ints, not a copy of the word. Stage 2 is an OPTIMIZATION, not
  a requirement: every job it does, stage 1 could also do alone, just
  by spelling every word out one character at a time. Stage 2 exists
  purely so common words get a single id instead of several, and
  purely because it's fast to build (one frequency sort, no
  iteration) is what makes skipping it for rare words an easy trade
  rather than a costly one.

  STAGE 2 IS CASE-INSENSITIVE -- unlike stage 1. "The", "the", and
  "THE" are matched to and share exactly ONE stage-2 entry (see
  TokenVocabulary.build()), so a word doesn't fragment the
  pre-defined-word budget across every capitalization it happens to
  appear in -- a sentence-initial "The" is the same word as a
  mid-sentence "the", not a different one. The tradeoff: decoding a
  stage-2 id always gives back that ONE stored (lowercase) spelling,
  never the original occurrence's exact casing -- see decode()'s
  docstring. This is scoped to stage 2 alone: a word stage 2 has no
  entry for still falls back to EXACT, case-preserving spelling
  through stage 1 (see CharWordTokenizer._encode_word()), and stage 1
  itself stays fully case-sensitive throughout.

  STAGE 2 NEVER STORES A ONE-CHARACTER "WORD" -- that would just be a
  second copy of something stage 1 already has an id for. A
  single-character word (an "a", an "I", a lone "." or "!") IS its
  stage-1 character id directly; stage 2 only ever assigns new ids to
  words of two or more characters.

  ONE SHARED ID SPACE, not two separate ones: stage 1's character ids
  and stage 2's word ids are drawn from the same increasing sequence,
  right after the reserved specials (<PAD>/<UNK>/<BOS>/<EOS>/
  <WORD_BOUND>). This is what lets a fallback-spelled word (see below)
  sit directly in the token stream CharWordTokenizer.encode() hands
  back -- every id in that stream, whichever stage minted it, means
  exactly one thing to decode() and to the rest of this codebase.

TRUE ZERO VOCABULARY LOSS FOR ANY WORD BUILT FROM KNOWN CHARACTERS:
stage 2 is a lookup table of PRE-DEFINED words, capped by
vocab_size -- but a word missing from that table is not the end of
the story the way it would be for a closed word-level vocabulary,
because stage 1 can build ANY word on demand from characters it
already knows, the same way stage 2's own recipes are built. A word
stage 2 has no entry for is simply spelled out live, character by
character, through stage 1 -- see CharWordTokenizer._encode_word().
<UNK> is only ever reached now for a genuinely unseen CHARACTER (one
that never appeared anywhere in training at all) -- not for an unseen
word.

<WORD_BOUND> (see config.py) is what makes two consecutive
stage-1-spelled words unambiguous at decode() time -- inserted before
every single-character word and every fallback-spelled multi-
character word, so a flat id stream always has an explicit marker for
"a new such word starts here" instead of relying on guesswork about
where one ends and the next begins.

Sentence splitting (split_sentences()) and case-folding word
segmentation (normalize(), still used directly by analyse.py's own
word-frequency analysis, independent of this tokenizer) live in this
same file now too -- they were always generic, never specific to
whichever vocabulary-building algorithm happened to consume them, so
there was never a real reason for them to live in a separate module.
